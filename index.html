          <p>Call me Amber! Edits (animation, thumbnail, etc.), fanart, and AMVS/GLMVS/GMVS are all in my expertise. Oh, and procrastination.
            One can't forget that element of my life. If anybody finds this website, well, you've come to the wrong place. Go back
            to your browsing and fanfiction and what not, cuz' I'm going too. I have nothing to do here either lol. Check my YT channel out (link above).
            Goodbye. Have a nice day. Don't think too hard about what you just saw. </p>
